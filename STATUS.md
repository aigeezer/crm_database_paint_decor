## Notes
The research phase has identified several unique requirements for painting and decorating contractors that differ from general CRM systems:
- Need for detailed property specifications relevant to painting work
- Estimation processes specific to paint/wallpaper/decorating materials
- Seasonal scheduling considerations
- Material tracking with specific color and finish information
- Integration requirements with painting-specific estimation tools

These insights will inform the database design to ensure it fully addresses industry-specific needs.
