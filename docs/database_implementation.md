## Database Structure

The database is organized into several key areas:

### Core Entities
- **Customers**: Information about residential and commercial clients
- **Properties**: Details about properties where work is performed
- **Projects**: Specific projects undertaken for customers
- **Estimates**: Cost estimates and proposals for projects
- **Services**: Standard services offered by the company

### Operational Entities
- **Team Members**: Staff and crew information
- **Schedule**: Calendar and scheduling functionality
- **Tasks**: Individual work items for projects
- **Materials**: Inventory and material tracking

### Financial Entities
- **Invoices**: Billing documents for customers
- **Payments**: Payment tracking for invoices
- **Expenses**: Cost tracking for projects

### Security Entities
- **Users**: User accounts for system access
- **Security Logs**: Audit trails for system actions
- **Data Access Logs**: Records of data access

## Entity Relationships

The database follows a normalized relational design with the following key relationships:

- A Customer can have multiple Properties
- A Property can have multiple Projects
- A Project has one or more Estimates, Tasks, Schedule Events, and Invoices
- A Project uses Materials and Team Members
- Invoices receive Payments
- Team Members are assigned to Projects and Schedule Events

For a complete visualization, refer to the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) in `/schema/erd.puml`.

## Implementation Steps

To implement the database:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - MySQL 8.0 or later (or compatible database)
   - Sufficient storage for database (min 1GB recommended)
   - Database user with CREATE privileges

2. **Database Creation**:
   - Run the initialization script from the project directory:
     ```
     ./deploy.sh
     ```
   - This script creates the database, tables, views, procedures, triggers, and indexes
   - Review the output for any errors

3. **Verification**:
   - The deployment script performs automatic verification
   - Check that all tables, views, procedures, and triggers were created successfully
   - Load sample data if needed for testing

4. **Configuration**:
   - Update configuration files with database connection information
   - Set appropriate permissions for database users
   - Configure backup schedules

## Security Features

The database includes comprehensive security features:

### Authentication and Authorization
- User accounts with role-based permissions
- Password hashing and secure storage
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Session management

### Audit Trails
- Security log for security-related actions
- Login log for authentication attempts
- Data access log for sensitive data access
- Automated timestamp tracking

### Data Protection
- Input validation at database level
- Data integrity constraints
- Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Role-Based Access
The system supports the following roles with varying permissions:
- Administrator: Full system access
- Manager: Full operational access
- Estimator: Estimate and project management
- Painter: Task and schedule access
- Office Staff: Customer, invoice, and report access
- Read-Only: View-only access to all data

## Data Migration

For existing businesses migrating to this system:

### Data Assessment
- Inventory all existing data sources
- Map fields from legacy systems to the new database
- Identify data quality issues

### Migration Process
1. Extract data from current systems
2. Transform data to match the new schema
3. Load data into the new database
4. Verify data integrity

### Migration Scripts
Custom migration scripts can be created to handle specific legacy systems. Template scripts are available for:
- QuickBooks data
- Excel spreadsheets
- Common CRM systems

## Integration Points

The database is designed to integrate with other systems:

### Accounting Integration
- Invoices and payments can sync with accounting systems
- Supported systems include QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks
- Integration occurs through the `accounting_integration` table

### Estimating Tools
- Estimates can be imported/exported from estimating software
- Color and material specifications are standardized
- Integration via API or file import/export

### Calendar Systems
- Schedule events can sync with Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.
- Two-way synchronization is supported
- Team members can receive notifications

## Performance Considerations

The database is optimized for common operations:

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys are indexed by default
- Foreign keys are indexed for join performance
- Additional indexes for common query patterns
- Full-text indexes for search functionality

### Query Optimization
- Views for complex queries
- Stored procedures for transactional operations
- Pagination for large result sets

### Scaling Considerations
- The database can handle up to 10,000 projects
- Performance reviews recommended at 5,000 projects
- Archiving strategy for completed projects

## Mobile Access

The database is designed for mobile field access:

### Data Access Patterns
- Read-optimized views for mobile queries
- Reduced payload sizes for limited bandwidth
- Offline capabilities with synchronization

### Synchronization
- Field changes merge with office updates
- Conflict resolution favors the most recent change
- Automatic retry for failed synchronization

### Mobile Security
- Field devices require authentication
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Remote wipe capabilities for lost devices

## Backup and Recovery

The database includes comprehensive backup features:

### Backup Schedule
- Full daily backups
- Incremental hourly backups
- Transaction log backups every 15 minutes

### Recovery Options
- Point-in-time recovery
- Table-level recovery
- Full database restoration

### Disaster Recovery
- Offsite backup storage
- Documented recovery procedures
- Regular recovery testing

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### Connection Issues
- Verify database server is running
- Check connection credentials
- Test network connectivity

### Performance Problems
- Review query execution plans
- Check for missing indexes
- Monitor server resource utilization

### Data Integrity
- Use constraints to enforce business rules
- Implement triggers for complex validations
- Regular data auditing
